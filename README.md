# Segmentation

This repository contains the source code for the Deep Learning in Computer Vision (DLVC) term project. It features three distinct segmentation methods for abdominal CT images: MONAI, Custom U-Net, and nnU-Net.

## Overview

- **MONAI and Custom U-Net**: Both frameworks are comprehensively implemented, encompassing all steps from data preprocessing to the calculation of final results and accuracy. These methods provide a complete end-to-end workflow for segmentation.

- **nnU-Net**: This framework is implemented partially, including detailed data preprocessing and training phases. Due to the GPU resource limitation  for training with a batch size of 2, the training component is not fully completed.

## Additional Information

For detailed explanations of the methodologies, implementation specifics, and insights into the challenges faced during the project, please refer to the pdf file of the term project report uploaded in NTU COOL and here. The report offers an extensive overview of the project results and the specific contributions of each segmentation framework utilized.
